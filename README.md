## What it does

- **Any agent, your choice.** Run each session on **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Cline** — pick a global default, switch it per terminal, or run the same session in two agents side by side. PR review, implement, CI-debug, and ask all follow your selected agent + model.
- **Sessions, your way.** A session is whatever you need — one repo or many. Pick the repos it touches (including straight from your recent GitHub repos, cloned on demand); each gets the same branch and its own worktree, with any number of agents you choose, even different ones side by side. Run several sessions at once — including more than one on the same repo — and resume any of them later with one click, every repo back with its agent conversations. Manage or delete sessions (worktrees included) from the sidebar. Columns, grid, or single-pane view; no more juggling `cd`s.
- **Repo-aware agents.** On session start, Klaussy analyzes the repo — extracting its conventions, rules, and import graph (fan-in/out, cycles, endpoint chains) — and gives your agents that context to draw on. PR review, Plan, Debug, and implement runs ground their work in how your codebase fits together instead of generic advice, and the analysis refreshes as the repo changes.
- **Auto-debug CI failures.** Klaussy connects to your PR's CI checks. When one goes red, pull the logs in with a click and your agent runs a focused debug pass — likely cause, suggested fix, applied straight to the worktree.
- **Full PR review surface.** Pull in a PR, read the diff with inline comments, run an AI review that breaks into per-finding cards — ignore, implement, or append to PR.
- **Plan · Debug · Review.** A dropdown on every worktree that spawns a dedicated agent tab running Klaussy's guided **Plan** flow, a **Debug** pass, or a multi-phase PR **Review** — each on the same worktree, no context loss.
- **Inline AI — locally.** Tab-autocomplete as you type, powered by `qwen2.5-coder` running on your machine via Ollama. ~100ms latency. No code leaves your laptop.
- **Agentic Git Hooks.** Klaussy embeds autonomous agents directly into your local Git workflow. Built-in pre-commit and pre-push hooks automatically run local agent checks over staged diffs, catching correctness landmines, silent failures, leaked secrets, and debug leftovers. By taking care of commit, code, and planning guardrails, Klaussy ensures your branch stays clean, safe, and stable before anything is pushed.
- **Built-in editor.** Monaco editor with LSP diagnostics. Open any file, edit, commit straight from the diff panel. AI-generated commit messages optional.

## How sessions work

Stack several on one repo, fan one across many repos, or mix agents inside a single session.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Many sessions, one repo.** Parallel sessions on the same repo — a feature here, a hotfix there. | **One session, many repos.** Every repo a change touches, same branch everywhere, side by side. | **One session, many agents.** Mix Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, and Cline in a single session. |

## Requirements

Klaussy runs on **macOS 12+** (Apple Silicon or Intel), **Windows 10/11**, or **Ubuntu 22.04+** (other modern Linux distros generally work).

You'll also need **at least one supported agent CLI or IDE extension** — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Google Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), or [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) — and the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com), all authenticated. Ollama is optional and only needed for local inline autocomplete.

## Install

Easiest: open **[klaussy.com](https://www.klaussy.com/#download-btn)** — it detects your OS and offers the right file directly.

Or grab the matching file from the [latest release](https://github.com/steph-dove/klaussy-desktop-feedback/releases/latest) using the picker below.

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b> — pick by chip type</summary>

Open the Apple menu → **About This Mac** and look at the **Chip** (or **Processor**) row.

| Your Mac says | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Apple M1 / M2 / M3 / M4 (Apple Silicon) | `Klaussy-<ver>-macOS-arm64.dmg` |
| Intel | `Klaussy-<ver>-macOS-x64.dmg` |

Open the `.dmg`, drag **Klaussy** into **Applications**, done. Klaussy is signed and notarized — no quarantine workaround needed.

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b> — installer or portable</summary>

| Want | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Standard install on Windows 10/11 | `Klaussy-<ver>-Windows-Setup.exe` |
| Portable (no install) | `Klaussy-<ver>-Windows-Portable.exe` |

Signed with an SSL.com EV certificate — Windows SmartScreen should pass cleanly.

<summary><b>Linux</b> — by distro</summary>

| Distro | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Pop!_OS | `Klaussy-<ver>-Linux-Debian-Ubuntu.deb` |

`.deb`: `sudo dpkg -i Klaussy-<ver>-Linux-Debian-Ubuntu.deb`

AppImage: `chmod +x Klaussy-<ver>-Linux.AppImage && ./Klaussy-<ver>-Linux.AppImage`

</details>

Klaussy auto-updates after install — no need to manually grab future versions.

## Setup

After installing Klaussy, install **at least one agent CLI** plus the GitHub CLI. Klaussy's first-run check tells you what's missing.

### Agents — install whichever you use (at least one)

All four are npm packages, so they need Node.js (`brew install node` on macOS, `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS` on Windows, `sudo apt install nodejs npm` on Ubuntu/Debian).

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code   # Claude Code   (Anthropic)
npm install -g @openai/codex               # OpenAI Codex
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli          # Google Gemini
npm install -g @github/copilot             # GitHub Copilot
```

Run each agent once to sign in (e.g. `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `cline`) — they use your own account/subscription.

### GitHub CLI (for PR review, checkout, CI)

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh && gh auth login
# Windows
winget install --id GitHub.cli && gh auth login
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install gh && gh auth login
```

### Ollama (optional — only for local inline autocomplete)

```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama
# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
# Windows — download from https://ollama.com/download
```

## FAQ

**Does my code get sent to third parties?**
When you use an agent, prompts + repo context go to that agent's provider via the CLI you already trust — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (Codex), Google (Gemini), GitHub (Copilot), Cursor, or Cline. GitHub operations go through your local `gh`. Inline autocomplete runs entirely locally via Ollama and `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` — nothing per-keystroke leaves your machine. There is no Klaussy server.

**Do I need a subscription for the agents?**
You need whatever plan each agent CLI you use is configured for — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, and Cline all run on your own accounts. Klaussy doesn't bill separately or charge for AI usage.

**Why the 2 GB download prompt for inline autocomplete?**
~500 MB is Ollama's runtime; ~1 GB is the `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` model weights. You only see this prompt if you opt in — otherwise a free word-based completer handles Tab.

**What happens to my data if I uninstall?**
- macOS: remove `~/Library/Application Support/Klaussy` and `~/Library/Logs/Klaussy`
- Windows: remove `%APPDATA%\Klaussy`
- Linux: remove `~/.config/Klaussy` and `~/.local/share/Klaussy`

Ollama and its models persist independently — uninstall it through your package manager and remove `~/.ollama`.

**Is this open source?**
Klaussy Desktop is source-available under the Sustainable Use License (SUL 1.0). You can view, customize, and build the software from source for personal use or development. For custom enterprise integrations, self-hosting, or custom AI routing, contact our team to partner. Bundled open-source components are listed in About → Licenses.

**What is the Sustainable Use License (SUL 1.0)?**
The Sustainable Use License is a source-available license. It allows individuals and organizations to inspect, modify, and run the code for personal use or development. However, commercial production usage requires a separate agreement, and you cannot use the software to host a competing service.
